Changes:
- Added BlockConveyor
    - Bounding Box is incorrect due to changes in model
    - onBlockActivated is missing wrench handling.
- Added TileConveyorBelt
    - Uses an array of ConveyorBeltLane instead of left and right variables.
    - advLane (formerly moveCole) has some bugs. I can't remember specifics but it had to do with the lane holding more items then it was supposed to.
    - Capabilities are not functioning.
    - getSlope needs more testing.
- Added TileRendererConveyorBelt.kt
    -Not implemented
- Added a copy of the conveyor api from Magneticraft 1.7
    - (IHitBoxArray) Changed function name from hasSpace(int pos) to isOccupied(int pos) as I felt it better reflected what it was doing.
-Changed registry.Blocks to add BlockConveyor
-Changed registry.TileEntities to add TileConveyorBelt

TODO:
- Fix rendering
    - The block renders and that's it.
- Double check getSlope and advLane in the class TileConveyorBelt
- Implement Capabilities
